Whenever she saw me she would run towards me and gladly sit in my lap. I didn't let my granma kill her and cook her for dinner. She refused to spare her life and Top eventually ended up in a soup. That I did not eat of course. I witnessed many of the executions my granma performed. She was considered a village executioner, specializing in poultry. Sometimes a hen would run away, in spite of her neck being cut and the head dangling lifelessly.",

It is actually not a portrait, but a ‘tronie’ – a painting of an imaginary figure, just like the Vermeer's painting. Unlike other European artistic traditions, Dutch art rarely depicts elderly women as disgusting or grotesque creatures, but rather they are idolized as figures of piety and purity whom the younger generations of women can look up to.",

My dad once told me that most people in his tiny, secluded village reported getting knocked down by lightening at least once in their lifetime. I believe they installed some lightening rods since then.",
